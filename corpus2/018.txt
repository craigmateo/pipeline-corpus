Coastal GasLink Pipeline Mechanical Construction Completed Ahead of the Year-End Deadline. Pipeline Business. Projects. The Coastal GasLink (CGL) pipeline that stretches across northern British Columbia (BC) is mechanically complete ahead of the company’s year-end deadline. The accomplishment marks a significant milestone for the project, which will deliver natural gas to the LNG Canada processing and export facility in Kitimat, on BC’s northern coast. “We are proud to announce the mechanical completion of the Coastal GasLink pipeline,” said TC Energy CEO Russ Girling. “This is a historic achievement and a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team.”. The mechanical completion of the pipeline means that all of the pipes have been installed and the line has been successfully hydrotested. The project team is now in the process of commissioning the pipeline and preparing to deliver gas to LNG Canada. “We are excited to take the next step and deliver gas to LNG Canada,” said Girling. “This is a major step forward for the LNG industry in British Columbia.”. The CGL pipeline is a 670-kilometre-long pipeline that will transport natural gas from northeastern BC to the LNG Canada facility in Kitimat. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct and indirect jobs and generate $5 billion in annual economic benefits for BC. The CGL project has faced a number of challenges, including protests and delays. However, the project team has persevered and is now on track to deliver gas in 2024. “We are committed to working with our Indigenous partners and communities to ensure that the CGL project is developed responsibly,” said Girling. “We believe that this project can be a benefit to all British Columbians.”.
