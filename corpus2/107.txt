Horgan says 'rule of law applies,' LNG pipeline will proceed despite protests. Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs say the project does not have their consent. Social Sharing. Premier John Horgan says a natural gas pipeline across northern British Columbia will be built despite ongoing protests and an eviction notice from some hereditary Indigenous leaders. The premier says the courts have ruled in favour of the project and the rule of law will apply to ensure work continues on the Coastal GasLink pipeline across northern B.C. to a coastal export terminal. The 670-kilometre pipeline is part of a $40 billion liquefied natural gas project. Horgan says the project has received approval from 20 Indigenous nations along the pipeline route and its completion is of vital economic and social importance to the region. Work must stop on Trans Mountain, Site C, LNG pipeline until First Nations approval, UN committee says. B.C. First Nation gives natural gas company one-time access to winterize site. Coastal GasLink has said it signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nations councils along the path, but five hereditary chiefs of the Wet'suweten First Nation say the project has no authority without their consent. Horgan made the comments at a news conference following a video meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, after a West Coast snow storm postponed a meeting scheduled between the two leaders in Victoria.
