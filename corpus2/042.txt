416-Mile Coastal GasLink Pipeline Project 98% Complete. By Mary Holcomb, Digital Editor. (P&GJ) — TC Energy’s Coastal GasLink pipeline project is 98% complete, signaling the culmination of a significant milestone in the development of the 670-km (416-mile) pipeline, according to the company’s September construction update. The pipeline, which began in 2012 and is co-owned with private equity firm KKR and Alberta Investment Management Corp., will transport natural gas to British Columbia's Pacific Coast for export. It has been dogged by delays and rising costs. "The biggest thing they need to do: the pipeline needs to be concluded," Darren Sissons, a partner at Campbell Lee & Ross, said on Sept. 8. "Get it done, stop wasting time. If you have to add a little bit of money, just get it done.". As the project nears mechanical completion scheduled for the end of 2023, the company provided recent accomplishments and critical activities that lie ahead. RELATED: Pipeline Operator TC Energy Plans to Complete Coastal GasLink Pipeline This Year. Section 5 of the Coastal GasLink pipeline, stretching over 54 km (34 miles) from north of Vanderhoof to south of Burns Lake, recently achieved a significant milestone. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of Nadleh-Macro, a partnership established in 2022 comprising Nadleh Whut’en First Nation and Macro Pipelines, the installation of pipes for Section 5 was successfully completed. This accomplishment in Section 5 adds to the list of completed sections within the 670-kilometer-long Coastal GasLink pipeline project. Sections 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 have all completed pipe installation activities, marking substantial progress in the development of this extensive pipeline network. Water Crossings Safely Executed. In a project of this magnitude, handling water crossings is a critical aspect. As of the end of August, all 800 water crossings, including 10 major trenchless water crossings, have been safely executed. This underscores the meticulous planning and execution by the project team, ensuring that the environment is respected and preserved during the construction phase. As the project moves closer to its mechanical completion date in 2023, several crucial activities remain on the agenda:. Clean-up and Reclamation: With sections of the pipeline now complete, the focus shifts to reinstating the ground and topsoil to prepare for the reclamation program. Work is already underway in various sections, with particular attention given to tasks that must be completed before the onset of winter. Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Measures: The commitment to environmental protection doesn't end with construction. Even after the project is complete, the Coastal GasLink team will continue to implement and monitor ESC measures. This ongoing effort is vital to protect the environment and fulfill their commitments, a task that may extend over a few years due to seasonal constraints. The Coastal GasLink pipeline project is rapidly approaching its mechanical completion, with 98% of the project now finished. The recent achievements in Section 5, coupled with the completion of pipe installation in multiple sections and the safe execution of water crossings, highlight the dedication of the project team and their commitment to safety and environmental protection. As the project enters its final phase, the focus shifts to reclamation and the ongoing implementation of erosion and sediment control measures. These activities underscore the project's commitment to leaving a positive environmental legacy in the regions it traverses. The Coastal GasLink pipeline project is on track to bring a reliable source of energy to communities while demonstrating that large-scale infrastructure development can coexist with environmental stewardship.
