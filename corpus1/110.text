 react-text: 114 This week, thousands of Native American protesters  /react-text marched on Washington, D.C., react-text: 116  making their way to the White House in an effort to talk to President Donald Trump about the  /react-text Dakota Access Pipeline react-text: 118  and Native American civil rights, according to  /react-text The Washington Post. react-text: 121 The  /react-text Dakota Access Pipeline react-text: 123  is a 1,172-mile crude-oil pipeline that  /react-text runs through four states react-text: 125 , beginning in  /react-text resource-rich oil fields in North Dakota react-text: 127  and ending in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its allies  /react-text have been protesting react-text: 129  the pipeline for months because, they claim, the route  /react-text threatens react-text: 131  their reservation and  /react-text sacred sites react-text: 133 . There’s also  /react-text potential react-text: 135  for the pipeline, once built, to pollute the nearby river, the reservation’s only water source, according to  /react-text The Atlantic. react-text: 137  In February, law-enforcement officials  /react-text removed and arrested react-text: 139  protesters who refused to leave the Standing Rock demonstration site  /react-text following an order react-text: 141  from North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum to clear the way for, ultimately,  /react-text pipeline construction react-text: 143  to resume. /react-text  react-text: 145 The pipeline, however, is just the latest incident in  /react-text a history of problems react-text: 147  with the U.S. government’s treatment of Native American tribes.  /react-text USA Today react-text: 149   /react-text reported react-text: 151  that the protest,  /react-text called react-text: 153  Native Nations Rise, has lasted four days and included several demonstrations. Protesters also built seven teepees on the National Mall to use as education space to talk about Native American issues and culture. According to the  /react-text Huffington Post, react-text: 155  demonstrators  /react-text marched react-text: 157  on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers headquarters while  /react-text chanting react-text: 159 : “You can’t drink oil. Keep it in the soil.” /react-text  react-text: 161 Despite the pipeline setbacks, Native American tribes and their supporters  /react-text remain hopeful react-text: 163  about the future. “I want people to feel like we haven’t been defeated,” Eryn Wise, a member of the International Indigenous Youth Council,  /react-text  react-text: 165 told  /react-text The Washington Post react-text: 167 . “My heart is broken, but I am so deeply moved by everything we accomplished. There is an ongoing threat to indigenous rights to our sacred lands and resources. But before Standing Rock, no one was having these conversations. We were able to be the catalyst for a greater movement, for a much needed conversation. We’re still here. We’re still fighting for our children’s futures. We’re still fighting for our territory.” /react-text  react-text: 169 The  /react-text Associated Press react-text: 171   /react-text reports react-text: 173  that the tribes will  /react-text continue their legal battle react-text: 175  to stop the pipeline, even though a federal judge in Washington, D.C.,  /react-text declined their request react-text: 177  to temporarily halt construction on March 7. “They need to start dealing with us because we are not going anywhere,” Raymond Kingfisher, a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana,  /react-text  react-text: 179 told the  /react-text Huffington Post react-text: 181 . “They need to honor our treaties and respect our rights.” /react-text The White House hasn’t commented on whether Trump will engage or meet with protesters at this time.Related: react-text: 185   /react-text Why the Dakota Access Pipeline Is So ControversialCheck this out: react-text: 302 ©  /react-text  react-text: 303 2018 /react-text  react-text: 304  Condé Nast.
