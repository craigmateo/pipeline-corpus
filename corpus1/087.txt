of a powerful movement against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline,
or DAPL, through land vital to Native communities, especially the Standing Rock
Sioux. For non-Native people who have not been paying attention to indigenous
rights struggles over the past several decades, the #NoDAPL movement may have
served as a wake-up call to some of the injustices still confronting these
communities.For others, as Tom
Hastings points out in “Turtle Island
2016 Civil Resistance Snapshot,” in the Journal for the
Study of Peace and Conflict, #NoDAPL is simply another in a long line of
civil resistance struggles Native communities have mobilized, often
successfully, to claim their rights.He highlights this
recent history of Native American and First Nations civil resistance movements
on Turtle Island—the name, from Lenape mythology, that refers to the landmass
others call North America—and takes stock of their characteristics, challenges
and successes, arguing that nonviolent resistance has been a more effective
strategy than violent resistance in defending Native peoples and their
“lifeways.”Hastings begins with the
fact that, unlike other identity groups struggling for justice in the United
States or Canada, indigenous groups can claim sovereign rights as nations with
their own governance structures — which also means that activists often
mobilize in tandem with, as opposed to against, their
tribal governments. Practically speaking, this fact provides indigenous
activists with an additional tool in their activist toolbox: the
nation-to-nation treaties previously negotiated with the settler governments of
the United States and Canada.Hastings notes that
occasionally simply mentioning the existence of a treaty, and the fact that
“tribal lawyers are standing by,” has been enough for action to be taken in
favor of Native communities. In other cases, of course, the process is not so
easy, but the existence of treaties as legal documents to which the federal
government must be held accountable helps enormously.For example, Hastings
recounts an incident in 1974 when two brothers from the Anishinaabe nation,
upon realizing that they had treaty rights to do so, “purposefully and openly
fished on off-reservation waters” and presented a copy of the treaty to the
game warden who came to arrest them. The matter was taken up in the courts, who
ultimately ruled in their favor. But although they had established their legal
right to fish in these off-reservation waters, they still faced the wrath of
angry mobs who met them with racial slurs and sometimes even violence as they
were trying to fish.Hastings himself, along with other allies with
the organization Witness for Peace, would, in the late 1980s/early 1990s,
accompany them to the fishing spot as a protective presence. Eventually, media
attention, which highlighted the contrast between the nonviolent Anishinaabe
people simply fishing and the “inebriated racists” trying to stop them, shifted
the opinion of the public and ultimately government officials in favor of
treaty rights. This case draws out a number of elements of
Native civil resistance that Hastings explores throughout the article, in
addition to treaty rights leverage: the strategic importance of nonviolent
discipline, the power of media in shaping the outcome, the key supportive role
that can be played by non-Native allies (as well as by indigenous allies
globally), and the ultimate need for broader public education and opinion change
on Native history, rights and struggles.Beyond treaty rights (mostly regarding access to
resources on land ceded in treaties—sometimes with dubious levels of consent—to
which tribes have historical ties), Hastings mentions mobilization around a
range of other issues: environmental protection, tribal health care, law
enforcement, borders/boundaries, tribal dignity, consultation (on various
policies affecting tribes), and basic sovereignty. Of these, he pays special attention to
anti-nuclear and anti-pipeline (environmental) activism against attempts to
store nuclear waste and extract or transport oil close to Native communities,
noting how these movements have become “more effective at drawing [in]
coalition partners and using their special sovereignty statuses to wield power
disproportionate to their populations.”Throughout the article, the complex and
multi-faceted nature of Native identity—and its relation to various forms of
resistance—emerges as a common theme. First, Hastings brings attention to the
importance of national (e.g., Sioux) and band (e.g., Brule Sioux) identities as
opposed to the blanket identity of “Native American” or “First Nation,” which
he says is more often used by non-Native people than by indigenous people
themselves. He does, however, note the way in which a pan-Native American
identity developed to some degree in the United States (through the emergence
of American Indian Movement activism in the late 1960s and1970s) whereas it did
not in Canada. Finally, he highlights the emergence of a
complicated warrior identity, both in relation to participation in the U.S.
military — often in the name of and to gain status for their tribal nations
rather than out of allegiance to an oppressive federal government — and in
relation to longstanding anti-settler resistance, including the resistance of
nonviolent “warriors.”Contemporary relevance.From April 2016 until
late February 2017, enduring a fierce winter, Standing Rock Sioux water
protectors and their allies created an encampment where they gathered and
prayed to resist the proposed construction nearby of the Dakota Access Pipeline
under the Missouri River and across their sacred sites. The encampment and its
acts of civil disobedience drew widespread media attention and support but also
brought repressive responses from local police and private security
companies.Although President Obama
temporarily halted construction in light of the Standing Rock people’s
concerns, President Trump has since reinstated the project, and the camp has
been dismantled. This article helps to situate the so-called #NoDAPL movement
in the broader context and history of settler colonialism, broken treaties,
exploitation and persistent indigenous civil resistance in North America.
Understanding construction of the pipeline as part of this continuum of
oppression, displacement and trust-violation endows the resistance movement
with greater meaning—a movement that needs to be seen not as an over-reaction
to an isolated incident but as a justified response to a steady onslaught of
injustices.More broadly, this history focuses attention on
the widespread modes of domination by which some groups of human beings
interact with both other groups of human beings and the natural
world—instrumentalizing both for self-centered gain with no regard for
indigenous self-determination or ecological balance. It is becoming abundantly
clear that such practices are neither socially nor environmentally sustainable.
As climate change becomes a clear and present danger, non-Native folks have
much to learn — and fast — from resistance movements and lifeways of indigenous
peoples about how to live sustainably without obliterating the world or one
another.Practical implications.For indigenous activists, this research
highlights the importance of maintaining nonviolent discipline, while also
thinking strategically about both the use of media and collaboration with
global and local allies to facilitate shifts in public opinion and create
broad-based movements that will be more resilient and have greater impact. For non-Native allies, it reminds activists of
the broader historical context informing indigenous struggles and what that
means for the significance of a specific movement itself but also for the role
of settler allies in that movement—those who benefit in many ways from the
forms of exploitation that have deprived Native communities of their
livelihoods and sacred places but who also have access to particular forms of
leverage that can put pressure on those spear-heading that exploitation and
dispossession today. For example, allies of #NoDAPL can go right to
the source and move their personal savings out of banks financing the DAPL
project and into local banks or community credit unions that are not. Going a
step further, they can mobilize their employers and cities to do the same. More
broadly, non-Native allies can educate their families, friends, and communities
on the historical and contemporary injustices facing Native communities so that
indigenous civil resistance movements can be met with even greater empathy and
support. Finally, activists should continue to draw out
the connections between local struggles like #NoDAPL and the broader global
climate justice movement. The former grounds and gives a human face to an issue
as daunting as energy consumption and climate change, while the latter provides
#NoDAPL and other such movements with additional urgency and wider relevance
that can galvanize broader publicity and mobilization.Molly Wallace is Contributing Editor at the Peace Science Digest and
