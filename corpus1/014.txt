In 2016 and 2017 he led the response to the pipeline protests that drew thousands of people and resulted in 761 arrests over a six-month span.Kirchmeier says some of his plans for the sheriff’s office were delayed by the prolonged protest, and he wants to continue serving.
    Oceti Sakowin camp in N.D. is the largest of three set up in opposition to the DAPL. The campers are concerned about the pipeline, but a history of tribal land losses and worries about climate change have helped turn the opposition into a movement.
